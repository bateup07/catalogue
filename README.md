Barclays API Catalogue
=======================
Brief specification

The brief is to create a simple API Catalogue that can be sorted in alphabetical order (ascending/descending).  It must be built responsively and in a way where it could be reused in multiple places.  The choice of framework/library or pure JS is up to you, but it should work within the latest version of Chrome.

Screenshots of the design are attached.

The three APIs should be titled following:
* Branch Details
* Product Details
* ATM Locator

=========================

Technologies used in this task
* Java 8
* Spring Boot
* Spring MVC
* JPA
* Thymeleaf
* Bootstrap

=========================

Scope for improvement
* Improved test cases for Catalogue Controller
* Acceptance Criteria tests (cucumber)
* Switch on DB connection facility
